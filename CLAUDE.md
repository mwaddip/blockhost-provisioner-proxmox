# Claude Instructions for blockhost-provisioner-proxmox

## SPECIAL.md (HIGHEST PRIORITY)

**Read and internalize `SPECIAL.md` at the start of every session.** It defines per-component priority weights — where to invest extra scrutiny beyond standard professional practice. All stats at 5 = normal competence. Stats above 5 = extra focus.

| Path pattern | Profile | Extra focus areas |
|---|---|---|
| `scripts/vm-gc.py` | S8 P6 E9 C4 I6 A5 L8 | Robustness (destroys resources), reliability (must be idempotent), edge cases (cleanup failures = data loss) |
| `scripts/build-template.sh` | S7 P6 E8 C4 I5 A5 L6 | Reliability (must be idempotent, runs once) |
| everything else | S9 P7 E9 C5 I7 A6 L7 | Robustness + reliability (VM lifecycle is unforgiving) |

See `SPECIAL.md` for full stat definitions and the priority allocation model.

## Interface Contracts (REFERENCE)

**Contract specs define how this package interfaces with the rest of the system.** Read and internalize the relevant contract before modifying CLI signatures, wizard exports, root agent actions, or the manifest. Do not rely on assumptions — read the contract.

| Contract | Covers | Read when... |
|----------|--------|-------------|
| `facts/PROVISIONER_INTERFACE.md` | The provisioner contract — manifest schema, CLI commands, wizard plugin, root agent actions, first-boot hook | Changing any interface the engine, wizard, root agent, or first-boot consumes |
| `facts/COMMON_INTERFACE.md` | blockhost-common's public API — config, vm_db, root_agent, cloud_init | Using any import from `blockhost.*` |

**This is the reference implementation.** The libvirt provisioner is being built against the same contract. If the contract needs to change, coordinate with the main session — both provisioners must stay in sync.

## Interface Integrity (PERSISTENT RULE)

**When interfaces don't match, fix the interface — never wrap the mismatch.** If something in the contract doesn't match reality, update the contract (and notify the main session), don't write a wrapper.

## Project Scope

**This Claude session only modifies blockhost-provisioner-proxmox.** Changes to dependency packages (blockhost-common, blockhost-broker, blockhost-engine) should be done in their respective Claude sessions with separate prompts.

## Project Overview

This is the Proxmox VM provisioning component of the Blockhost system, providing NFT-based web3 authentication. Read `PROJECT.yaml` for the complete machine-readable API specification.

**Dependencies:**
- `blockhost-common` - Provides `blockhost.config`, `blockhost.vm_db`, and `blockhost.root_agent` modules
- `blockhost-broker` - IPv6 tunnel broker (broker-client saves allocation to `/etc/blockhost/broker-allocation.json`)


## Environment Variables

Essential environment variables (contract addresses, deployer key, RPC URL) are stored in:
```
~/projects/sharedenv/blockhost.env
```

Source this file before running scripts that interact with the blockchain:
```bash
source ~/projects/sharedenv/blockhost.env
```

## Quick Reference

```bash
# Engine-driven: create VM, get JSON summary
python3 scripts/vm-generator.py <name> --owner-wallet <addr> --nft-token-id <id> --apply

# Engine-driven with pre-rendered cloud-init
python3 scripts/vm-generator.py <name> --owner-wallet <addr> --nft-token-id <id> --apply \
    --cloud-init-content /path/to/rendered.yaml

# VM lifecycle commands
blockhost-vm-start <name>
blockhost-vm-stop <name>
blockhost-vm-kill <name>
blockhost-vm-destroy <name>
blockhost-vm-status <name>
blockhost-vm-list [--json]

# Update VM GECOS after ownership transfer
blockhost-vm-update-gecos <name> <wallet-address> --nft-id <id>

# Garbage collect expired VMs
python3 scripts/vm-gc.py [--execute] [--grace-days N]

# Build/rebuild Proxmox template
./scripts/build-template.sh
```

## Mandatory: Keep PROJECT.yaml Updated

**After ANY modification to the scripts, you MUST update `PROJECT.yaml`** to reflect:

1. **New/changed CLI arguments** - Update the `entry_points` section
2. **New/changed Python functions** - Update the `python_api` section
3. **New/changed config options** - Update the `config_files` section
4. **New cloud-init templates** - These belong in `blockhost-common`; update `external_modules` section if needed
5. **Changed workflow/behavior** - Update the `workflow` section

### Update Checklist

When modifying any script, ask yourself:
- [ ] Did I add/remove/change any command-line arguments?
- [ ] Did I add/remove/change any Python class methods?
- [ ] Did I add/remove/change any configuration options?
- [ ] Did I change the workflow or data flow?

If yes to any, update `PROJECT.yaml` accordingly.

### From blockhost-common package

| Module/File | Purpose |
|-------------|---------|
| `blockhost.config` | Config loading (load_db_config, load_web3_config, load_broker_allocation) |
| `blockhost.vm_db` | Database abstraction (VMDatabase, MockVMDatabase, get_database) |
| `blockhost.root_agent` | Root agent client (qm_start/stop/shutdown/destroy, ip6_route_add/del) |
| `blockhost.cloud_init` | Cloud-init template rendering (render_cloud_init, find_template) |
| `/etc/blockhost/db.yaml` | Database and terraform_dir config |
| `/etc/blockhost/web3-defaults.yaml` | Blockchain/NFT settings |

## Configuration

### terraform_dir

The `terraform_dir` setting in `/etc/blockhost/db.yaml` specifies where:
- Generated `.tf.json` files are written
- Terraform commands are executed

This is typically a separate directory with Proxmox provider credentials and terraform state.

### Mock vs Production Database

- `--mock` flag uses `MockVMDatabase` backed by `accounting/mock-db.json`
- Production uses `VMDatabase` with file at path specified in `/etc/blockhost/db.yaml`

## Testing Changes

Always test with mock database first:
```bash
python3 scripts/vm-generator.py test-vm --owner-wallet 0x1234... --nft-token-id 0 --mock --apply
```

## Package Integration

When installed as a package:
1. Install `blockhost-common` first (provides config and database modules)
2. Install `blockhost-provisioner-proxmox` (this package)
3. Configure `/etc/blockhost/db.yaml` with correct `terraform_dir`
5. Configure `/etc/blockhost/web3-defaults.yaml` with contract details
6. Run scripts via: `blockhost-vm-create`, `blockhost-vm-gc`, etc.

## NFT Token ID Management

The engine owns the full NFT lifecycle (token ID reservation, encryption, minting).
The provisioner receives `--nft-token-id` from the engine, bakes it into cloud-init
GECOS, creates the VM, and echoes the token ID back in the JSON summary.

## Pre-Push Documentation Check

**Before creating a commit or pushing to GitHub**, you MUST:

1. **Re-read `PROJECT.yaml`** and verify it reflects all changes made in this session
2. **Re-read `CLAUDE.md`** and verify the Quick Reference, Key Files table, and other sections are still accurate
3. **Fix any stale documentation** before committing — do not push code that contradicts the docs

This applies to every commit, not just large changes. Small changes (renamed flags, new imports, changed defaults) can silently make docs wrong.

## VM Authentication Flow

1. VM boots with libpam-web3 installed via cloud-init template
2. `web3-auth-svc` serves signing page over HTTPS (port 8443, self-signed TLS)
3. User visits `https://VM_IP:8443`, signs challenge with their wallet
4. PAM module validates signature locally and checks wallet against GECOS

The signing page is served by web3-auth-svc over HTTPS. With callback support (v0.6.0+), the page auto-fills OTP and machine name — users just sign and press Enter.
